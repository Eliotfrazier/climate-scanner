Following the shocking UN report estimating that 1,000,000 species are threatened with extinction and that urgent transformative change is needed, Houdini has announced The Regenerative Lifestyle Initiative, where the company is identifying attractive lifestyle solutions that have the potential to drastically reduce the use of material resources and safeguard and protect half of earth for nature. A trailblazer in sustainable innovation in its quest to become regenerative, it is a two-year project exploring what an attractive lifestyle well within planetary boundaries could look like and if scaling it could enable the Half-Earth Project of setting aside half of our planet to safeguard biodiversity, celebrate all life on earth and manifest the beauty and intrinsic value of nature."}
