There is at least an equal if not larger risk of people heading towards fascism, of course, and there is a certainty, in my eyes, that our current path will not only ensure that but offers no solutions of its own, but that just means that regardless of it's probability, socialism is the only path which offers any hope that I can see."}

We held a fundraising dinner in May and although we raised a reasonable sum of money it is not enough to get the Park through the dry season and definitely not enough to spend on major rehabilitation like the work being done at the moment on the boreholes."}
