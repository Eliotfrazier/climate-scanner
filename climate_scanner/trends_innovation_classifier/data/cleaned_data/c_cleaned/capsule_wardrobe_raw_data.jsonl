One \u201cminimal\u201d style blog, Un-Fancy, offers up these suggestions for curating a capsule wardrobe: \u201cIf picking a number doesn\u2019t jive with you, listen to your intuition\u2014it\u2019ll tell you when you have enough.\u201d The blogger, Caroline, used her intuition to choose 37 items for her capsule wardrobe\u2013but rather than those 37 items being worn year-round, they are meant to be seasonal items for a three-month period. After those three months, she \u201ctypically end[s] up getting between 4-8 new pieces for each new season.\u201d Caroline calls this wardrobe approach \u201cgenerous yet minimal.\u201d I\u2019m sure that many people with much larger wardrobes would not call this generous, but at the same time I\u2019m not so sure it can be considered minimal either\u2013especially when contrasted with Susie Faux\u2019s original capsule wardrobe concept of around a dozen items meant to be worn year-round, every year."}
