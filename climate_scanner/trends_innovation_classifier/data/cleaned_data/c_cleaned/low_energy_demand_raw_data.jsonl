(b) CDR deployment and overshoot\nTo assess the implications of our sensitivity analysis for the question of overshooting 1.5\u00b0C, the range of cumulative CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes needs to be related to the range of remaining CO2 emissions budgets for staying below 1.5\u00b0C discussed in \u00a72a. We assume that land-use CO2 emissions after 2020 can be effectively limited to a cumulative amount of 50 GtCO2, which is on the low end of values from the SSP-based 1.5\u00b0C pathways."}

Public Acceptance as a Major Bottleneck\nIn recent years a large debate on feasibility and sustainability has emerged around deep decarbonization with a particular focus on negative emissions as previously discussed. As these are mostly contributed in the form of BECCS, public acceptance is actually a problem on two fronts: on the one hand, CCS is unpopular due to concerns about it being a strategy in favor of prolonging the profitability of the fossil fuel industry (Shackley et al., 2009; Upham & Roberts, 2011; and indirectly also Wallquist, L\u2019Orange Seigo, Visschers, & Siegrist, 2012)."}
