Rashida Tlaib, D- Mich., among the first supporters of the resolution and who campaigned on a Green New Deal, said via email. \u201cJust this week we heard about how GM, a company that has received billions and billions from taxpayers, is planning to cut thousands of jobs here. So it\u2019s really exciting to be talking about rapidly building up our green, renewable energy infrastructure, because these are jobs that can and should go to our workers here in Michigan."}
