According to the University of Southern Indiana and the American Forest and Paper Association, here are some paper usage statistics:\n- Americans use 85 million tons of paper each year, which is the equivalent of 680 pounds per person\n- Only about 2/3 of paper products are recycled\n- The average American uses the equivalent of seven trees worth of paper goods each year\nBut the environmental impacts of remote work and the environmental impacts of going paperless in the workplace don\u2019t end with a reduction in paper consumption. Even one saved tree can remove up to 14.7 pounds of carbon dioxide from the air, cutting greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the course of a year."}
