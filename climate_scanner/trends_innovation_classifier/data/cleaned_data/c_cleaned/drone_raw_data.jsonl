New technologies have the potential to accelerate access to healthcare, commodities and data for beneficiaries, providers and policy-makers. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are one example of technology that can have a multitude of public health applications including supply chain support (eg, transport of medications, vaccines, biological samples), emergency response (eg, transport of blood and plasma), disease prevention (eg, sterile mosquito release for vector control), deployment of networks for data harvesting in unconnected areas, and health research.2\u20139 In order to meet different needs, drones are available in various sizes, payload capacities, flight ranges, energy sources, propulsion systems, take-off/recovery methods, cargo delivery configurations, automation levels and costs.5\nIn 2014, for the first time, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res demonstrated the potential of drones in healthcare by transporting sputum samples for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in Papua New Guinea.10 11 Since then, drone-based healthcare projects have emerged worldwide for a wide array of use cases."}
