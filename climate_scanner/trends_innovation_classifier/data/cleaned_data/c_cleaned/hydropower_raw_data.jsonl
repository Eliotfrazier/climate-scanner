Ultimately, the goal of renewable development must be to minimize our ecological footprint and if the social and ecological costs are too damaging then that is something which needs to be addressed now, not at some point down the line. We now have the necessary tools to help assess sites for hydro and extra-careful consideration needs to be given when planning and building new plants."}
