Personally i'd like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and MASK get full Hollywood remakes.Leave them alone, why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place? The thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson.Love to see Transformers with real actors and CGI."}
