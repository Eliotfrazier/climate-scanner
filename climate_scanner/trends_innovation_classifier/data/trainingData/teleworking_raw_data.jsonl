Working as little as one to two days a week at home can reduce the number of cars on the road, which leads to less traffic congestion and less wear and tear on the road, and reduces the amount of greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere. Consider this: If 3.9 million people worked from home at least half time, that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an amount equivalent to removing 600,000 cars for an entire year!"}
