In the Introduction, Green House members Brian Heatley, Rupert Read and John Foster explain that \u201cthere is a mismatch between the climate crisis and the political institutions and ideologies being looked to for solutions, especially under neoliberalism\u2026 Adaptation is transformative when it is premised not on preserving as much as possible of our present world \u2013 of uninterrupted human \u2018progress\u2019 and material prosperity \u2013 as is compatible with accommodating the climate and ecological damage which we have already done, but rather on responding to that damage through open-ended change in our institutions, practices and policies across the board.\u201d\nIn our chapter, \u201cMaking the best of climate disasters: on the need for a localized and localizing response\u201d, Rupert and I address the fact that climate change inevitably means disaster. Of many different kinds, from the hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires and record-breaking heatwaves we\u2019re seeing already to disasters whose shape and size we can\u2019t begin to imagine."}
